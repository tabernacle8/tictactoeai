How does it work (Bot features):

This program works with three modes. Easy, normal and hard. Easy is nothing special actually. It randomly tries to pick a space until it finds an empty space and places it's move there.

Normal mode is a little more complex. Medium mode is only concerned with defence and not offence. For example, it will block all wins by you but will not always win if it has the chance. Brute force guessing comes into play here where the bot checks all possible rows and sees if they are 2/3 way filled in. This means that you would need to make one more move to win (which is bad). Therefore if any rows are found where you are about to win, the bot will plasce its move there.

Hard mode is the same as Normal mode however the bot will play offence. The bot will first see if it can go anywhere to complete a row (hence it would win) and then it will check if you can win and block you if you could win. Also, if you do not chose the middle on your first play, the bot will 100% choose the middle space. If you place your first and second move on a corner, the bot will 100% place its first **2** moves on corners to ensure that it can win. If the bot still cant figure out where to go after this, it will randomly guess a space and go there.

Thats really all there is. Its simple but effective allowing the bot to win against unskilled players and tie even the most skilled players.
